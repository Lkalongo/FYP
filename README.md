# Final Year Project 

My project is an android application most simply explained as a movie watch list mobile application.

The app allows the user to search through an online database and add the films of their choosing categorising them into 3 different sections: Watchlist, Watching, and Finished.

The user can search through an online database which gets the name and details of the film displaying them for the user to see and add to one of the categories stated before.
